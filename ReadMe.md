# PowerCLI lab for VMware Users Group Demo Days 2012
We made a lab (Boren, Crawford, Ruddy, Wuchner) in which people could come and learn via hands on exercises.  These are some of the materials from said lab, as they were in 2012.

Materials include things like the lab guide we created, and the PowerShell code used to administer that lab.
